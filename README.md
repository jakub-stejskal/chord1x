Wish to be the most simple chordbook out there =) 
As I'm fed up with all those fancy pages full of lame chords or lyrics in shitty order. 
This is also my first real project in rubby after attenging SaaS class on http://www.edx.org
I'll try to make this work with propper BDD and TDD driven development. 
The intention is also to create API along with the page itself so that it's simple to be used
in native mobile app etc. The true goal is to make ultimate list of songs me and my friends are playing
be able to generate pdf of it and have your chords always by you on your phone as a backup solution. 
The usage of standards and "modern" web techniques are to be considered during development. 
HTML5 and CSS3 friendly, use opengraph, microformats (if they're still alive), find standardized format
for storing chords etc. Let's the hacking begin.
